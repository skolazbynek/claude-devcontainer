#!/usr/bin/env bash
# runtests entrypoint: materialize a jj revision in an isolated workspace and
# run pytest against it. All args are passed straight through to pytest.
#
#   REVISION            revset to test (default: @). Resolved without snapshotting
#                       /repo's working copy, so `@` means its last snapshot.
#   PROJECT_SUBDIR      dir under the workspace holding pyproject.toml (default: .)
#   SECRETS_FILE        env file sourced into pytest's environment (default: /secrets/.env)
#   POETRY_INSTALL_ARGS flags for `poetry install` (default: --all-extras --all-groups,
#                       so test deps get installed however they're declared -- poetry
#                       groups or PEP 621 extras). Override e.g. for --no-root.
#   PYTEST_ADDOPTS      default pytest opts (default: short tracebacks, quiet, no
#                       warnings, stop after 30 failures -- keeps output small).
#                       Explicit args passed to the container still override these.
#   OUTPUT_MAX_BYTES    cap on returned output; only the last N bytes (which hold
#                       pytest's summary) are emitted, with a truncation notice.
#   VENV_CACHE*         venv cache controls, see venv-cache.sh (the cache is
#                       used only when the broker mounts it at /cache).
#
# The repo store is bind-mounted at /repo; the isolated working copy is created
# under $HOME via `jj workspace add`, which never touches the store's default
# workspace @ or bookmarks.
