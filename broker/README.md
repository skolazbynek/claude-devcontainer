# cld host broker

The host-side glue that lets a `cld task-agent` or ticket
container trigger a fixed set of host-side actions -- run the target repo's
tests, enumerate cld containers, drive a GraphQL server -- without ever
seeing the secrets. The `task-agent` launcher action gates `<target>` on the
caller's host-set labels; since the master role was removed nothing carries an
`org.cld.targets` allowlist any more, so that action reaches nothing but the
caller's own repo-root and is pending a ticket-scoped rework. `run-tests`,
`list-containers` and `graphql` are what containers actually reach --
`graphql`'s role gate, like `run-tests`', is prompt-based only (persona/skill
text), not mechanical (see `../docs/design-cld-broker.md` §16). Agents and
task-agents are instructed (persona prompts, not enforced here) to only run
`run-tests` or `graphql` with their master's explicit per-invocation
authorization.

A container asks over SSH; a dedicated, single-purpose `sshd` answers with a
forced command (`cld-broker.py`). It serves **any repo that has a running
agent, task-agent or ticket container** -- no whitelist: it resolves the target repo
from the calling container's `org.cld.repo-root` label, resolves which change
that session is on (reading the jj store, never touching the working copy),
and for `run-tests` runs the standalone [`runtests`](../runtests/) container
against it, mounting the repo's raw `.env` into that ephemeral runner.
`claude` only ever sees the streamed output. See `../docs/design-cld-broker.md`
for the full design.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `cld-broker.py` | the `ForceCommand` target; the only thing the key can run |
| `broker.conf.sample` | broker-wide config (image, PATH, ssh-agent socket); copy to `/etc/cld/broker.conf`. Read as plain `KEY=VALUE` lines, never sourced: shell quoting works, `$VAR` expansion does not |
| `sshd_cld_broker.conf` | sample config for the dedicated `sshd` instance |
| `keygen.sh` | generate the broker keypair, host key, and `authorized_keys` |
| `cld-cld-brokerctl.sh` | operate the sshd: `start` / `restart` / `shutdown` / `status` / `logs`; `run` an action from the host |

## Operating

After first-time setup, symlink `cld-cld-brokerctl.sh` onto your PATH and drive the
daemon with it — it starts sshd detached, tracks it by PID file, and logs to a
file, so there are no sshd flags to remember:

```
cld-brokerctl start | restart | shutdown | status | logs [N] | graphql-sweep | run ...
```

It reads `$CLD_BROKER_DIR` (default `~/.cld/broker`). `restart` is the one to run
after editing the broker config or rebuilding the `runtests` image.

### Running an action from the host

For debugging, run any action directly, without sshd and without a container:

```
cld-brokerctl run [-C <repo>] [-r <revset>] [-s <session>] [-t <target>]... <action> [args...]
cld-brokerctl run run-tests -k login -x tests/
cld-brokerctl run -r main graphql start
```

It runs the installed `ForceCommand` from the sshd config, with that config's
`SetEnv` lines and an otherwise cleared environment, so `broker.conf` and its
`PATH` apply as they do for a container. The flags supply the `Caller` (see
"Adding an action") that labels supply on the ssh route:

| Flag | Caller member | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-C` | `repo` | the repo containing the current directory |
| `-r` | `revision` | `@`, your working copy (jj snapshots it first, so uncommitted edits count) |
| `-s` | `name` | `cld_host_<repo dir name>` |
| `-t` (repeatable) | `targets` | the repo alone |

Everything after the action goes to it as given. An action's `--repo` selector
is refused: it picks a ticket container's mounted repo, so on the host use `-C`.
A graphql server started this way has no container named after its session,
so the orphan cleanup reaps it on the next `graphql start` or `status` from any
caller.

## Setup (once, host-side)

Assumes the `runtests` image is built (`../runtests/build.sh`) and the docker
socket is **not** exposed to any container (that is what keeps the broker as
claude's only host channel).

1. **Keys.** `./keygen.sh /etc/cld` (or any dir), then note the printed
   `known_hosts` line.
2. **Config.** Copy `broker.conf.sample` to `/etc/cld/broker.conf` and
   set `RUNTESTS_IMAGE` + `PATH`. `PATH` must include both `docker` and `cld`
   (the `task-agent` action runs host-side `cld task-agent`). There
   is nothing per-repo to set -- the repo and its secrets path are resolved per
   request. Set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` too if the agents and task-agents launched
   through the broker should be able to push (see the sample for why a
   login-shell agent's socket path will not do).
3. **Broker script.** Install `cld-broker.py` at `/opt/cld/cld-broker.py`
   (path referenced by `ForceCommand`), `chmod +x`.
4. **sshd.** Edit `sshd_cld_broker.conf` (`AllowUsers`, `ListenAddress` for your
   bridge gateway, key paths), then launch the dedicated instance:
   ```
   /usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/cld/sshd_cld_broker.conf -D
   ```
   It runs the forced command as `AllowUsers`, so that user must own the target
   repos, read their `.env`s, and have docker access.

## Verify (no container needed)

The repo is resolved from the calling container's label, so the smoke test needs
a container named like the session carrying that label (a real cld container, or
a throwaway):

```
REPO=/abs/path/to/some/repo
docker run -d --name cld_agent_demo --label org.cld.repo-root="$REPO" alpine sleep 300
jj -R "$REPO" bookmark create cld_agent_demo -r @

payload=$(printf '%s\0' -k some_test -x | base64 -w0)
ssh -i /etc/cld/broker_key \
    -o UserKnownHostsFile=<known_hosts> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes \
    -p 2222 <user>@172.17.0.1 -- "run-tests cld_agent_demo $payload"

# rejected: anything but a defined action, or a malformed/unknown session
ssh ... -- "deploy cld_agent_demo $payload"        # -> denied (bad action)
ssh ... -- "run-tests ../../etc/passwd $payload"    # -> denied (bad session)
ssh ... -- "run-tests cld_agent_nope $payload"     # -> denied (no such container)

docker rm -f cld_agent_demo; jj -R "$REPO" bookmark delete cld_agent_demo
```

## Adding an action

The broker dispatches `$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` (`<action> <session> <base64-argv>`)
to a Python function named `action_<name>` (hyphens → underscores). To add one,
define a function in `cld-broker.py` — that's the whole change:

```python
def action_lint(caller: Caller, argv: list[str]) -> None:
    repo = caller.repo("")
    rev, secrets = resolve_test_context(caller, repo)
    _exec(["docker", "run", "--rm", "--user", f"{os.getuid()}:{os.getgid()}", "-e", "HOME=/tmp",
           "-v", f"{repo}:/repo", "-e", f"REVISION={rev}",
           _setting("LINT_IMAGE") or "runlint:latest", *argv])
```

It receives the `Caller` the dispatcher built and the decoded argv as a list.
`Caller` is the seam between the two domains of the script: the caller source
answers who called and what they may reach, the actions consume the answers as
plain values. It has four members, all resolved lazily, so read-only actions
don't depend on inputs they don't use:

| Member | Meaning | `LabelCaller` (the sshd route) |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | session id; names the caller's own resources | the container name |
| `repo(selector)` | host repo to act on; `selector` is the `--repo` name | `org.cld.repo-root`, or `org.cld.repo.<name>` for a ticket |
| `revision(repo)` | caller's current commit, `None` if unresolvable | jj `<session>@` in that repo |
| `targets()` | repos the caller may launch task-agents for | `org.cld.repo-root` + `org.cld.targets` |

`run-tests` calls `resolve_test_context` for the revision and the secrets
`.env` / `PROJECT_SUBDIR`. Feeding actions from another source (e.g. inputs
given on a host CLI) means implementing `Caller` once; no action changes. The script uses the Python standard library only
(3.12+), so the host needs no venv. Call it from a container with `cld broker lint <args>`
(action name is the first argument; `run-tests` needs no special-casing). An
action name that has no matching function is denied, so enabling/disabling is
just defining/removing the function.

**Built-in actions:** `run-tests` (pytest in the `runtests` container),
`list-containers` (read-only cld-container enumeration for the messenger /
`cld task-agent status`), `task-agent` (`<target> <op>` -- the `cld task-agent`
lifecycle verbs), and `graphql` (`<op> [args...]` -- start/stop/restart/status/
logs for the calling session's own GraphQL server, plus query/introspect/
endpoints against it or a credentialed alias; see
`../docs/impl-graphql-broker-plan.md` and `../docs/graphql-mcp.md`). The
`task-agent` action validates `<target>` against the caller's host-set
`org.cld.repo-root` + `org.cld.targets` labels through
`validate_target`; `graphql`, like `run-tests`, instead operates on the
calling session's own repo (the session's `org.cld.repo-root` label), since it
has no separate target to launch.

Both `run-tests`' `resolve_test_context` and `graphql`'s
`resolve_graphql_context` resolve the session's revision by calling `jj`
unconditionally -- neither action works against a git-backed repo (jj
resolution `exit 3`s). `graphql`'s read-only ops (`status`/`logs`/`stop`/
`endpoints`) avoid this by not resolving a revision at all; only `start` (and
by extension `restart`) needs it.

`task-agent` is the only action that creates a container with a caller-chosen file
mounted inside it, so it also polices its argv: `--force` is denied (overriding a
reap-readiness refusal stays a human act), a caller-supplied `--parent` is denied and
the validated `$session` appended instead -- both in either spelling, `--opt` and
`--opt=value` -- and `start`'s persona positional must be a bare name (an `@ref`) -- a
path there would let a container read any host file you can. The positional check
knows which `start` options take a *separate* value (`-n`/`-p`/`--branch`/`-m`/`-r`/
`--peer`) rather than assuming every `-*` token consumes the next one, which would
let the token after an `--opt=value` slip by unchecked.

## Security notes

- **Scoped, not dynamic.** The action set and `ForceCommand` are fixed host-side.
  The caller controls only the action (must map to a defined function), a
  validated session id, and the argv. The target repo is taken from the calling
  container's host-set label, not caller input -- so the caller can only reach a
  repo that already has an agent, task-agent or ticket container, never an arbitrary host path.
- **No injection.** argv arrives base64(NUL-joined) and is decoded into an argv
  array, never `eval`'d -- it can only become arguments to the action's command.
- **Blast radius.** A leaked broker key unlocks `run-tests`/`list-containers` for
  any repo that has a running agent, task-agent or ticket container (no
  per-container key isolation in this design) -- more surface than before this
  key reached agent/task-agent containers too. The `task-agent` launcher action
  validates its `<target>` against a host-set label the key alone can't forge.
  With
  `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` configured that includes launching an agent that holds your
  forwarded ssh-agent, so the key buys signing inside a container it spawns and
  not only `run-tests`. Leave it unset to keep every broker-launched agent
  structurally unable to push.
- **Network scope.** Bind the instance to the docker bridge gateway so only
  containers on the bridge can reach it.
