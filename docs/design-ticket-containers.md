## 1. Module layout

v2 is built **alongside** the v1 `cld master` / bare-devcontainer code (§8);
nothing is removed in this design. New logic goes into new modules so v1
removal later is a deletion, not a disentanglement.

| Module | Status | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `cld/registry.py` | new | `RepoEntry`, registry load (from `Config`), TOML writes (add/rm), interactive picker, ad-hoc-path resolution (basename → subdir name, collision = error) |
| `cld/manifest.py` | new | `RepoManifestEntry` / `TicketManifest` dataclasses, JSON label codec, `resolve_manifest()` (args + registry → manifest), manifest diff for repo-set change, label readback from `docker inspect` |
| `cld/ticket.py` | new | ticket lifecycle: start/stop/restart/shutdown/status/logs, `cld claude` exec, `cld shell`, single-session refusal, host-side per-repo teardown (`bookmark forget` + `workspace forget` per manifest entry), readiness wait scaled by repo count |
| `cld/cli.py` | changed | registers the 8 lifecycle verbs as root-level `@app.command()`s beside `run`/`build`/`prompts` (`cli.py:130,1095,1139`), each taking `<ticket>` as its **own command's** positional — safe; only the root *group* callback must never take one (the typer hazard, `cli.py:120-123`). `repos` is a new sub-typer like `bridge_app` (`cli.py:1027-1031`). The root callback stays `invoke_without_command=True` for the v1 bare devcontainer while the two coexist. |
| `cld/cli_container.py` | changed | host-only stubs gain the new verbs (`cli_container.py:42-64` pattern); `repos` (`:353-374`) switches from `MASTER_TARGETS` env to the manifest env; `find_target_repo` callers (`:85,110`) route through the ticket-aware resolver (§6.5) |
| `cld/docker.py` | changed | `ticket_container_name()`, manifest label stamping, per-repo mounts/env in a new `build_ticket_container_args()`, prefix-map path translation (§6.4), overlap-check rework (§7) |
| `cld/config.py` | changed | `[repos.*]` table parsing into `Config.repos: dict[str, RepoEntry]` (`_load_toml` today rejects tables, `config.py:130-155`); template block in `config.default.toml` |
| `imgs/claude-devcontainer/entrypoint-claude-devcontainer.sh` | changed | grows a `TICKET_MODE` branch: the per-repo boot loop (§4). The v1 master/agent/bare branches stay untouched. |
| `imgs/claude-devcontainer/container-init.sh` | changed | `link_workspace_files` parameterized per repo; ticket CLAUDE.md writer; `HOST_PROJECT_DIR` fix (§9) |
| `cld/vcs/scratch.py` | changed | default-payload mode (no `AGENT_SCRATCH` env, §4.2); docstring fix (§9) |
| `broker/cld-broker.sh`, `cld/broker.py` | changed | repo target parameter + manifest validation (§6.1) |
| `cld/messenger/identity.py` | changed | host-side `resolve_self` replacement (§6.5) |

Why `cld/ticket.py` + thin verbs in `cli.py`, not a `ticket_app` sub-typer:
the spec's daily verbs are `cld start` / `cld claude <ticket>` — root-level by
ruling (§5). A sub-typer (`cld ticket start`) would contradict the ruled
surface; a separate `cli_ticket.py` typer module registered into `app` buys
nothing over plain functions in `ticket.py` called from thin `cli.py`
commands, and the existing split (`docs/design-cli-split.md`) already
establishes "logic module + two CLI front-ends" as the pattern
(`cld/task_agent.py`).

Name check: none of `start claude shell stop restart shutdown status logs
repos` collides with an existing root command; v1 `master`/`agent` sub-apps
keep their own `restart`/`status`/`shutdown` namespaced under themselves.

## 2. Launch manifest

The manifest is the resolved repo set stamped at launch, the single source of
truth for `restart`, `status`, and broker validation (spec §3). It fixes v1's
parameter-dropping restart (`cli.py:422` relaunches with four empty strings).

### 2.1 Schema

One JSON document:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "ticket": "lide-2600",
  "repos": [
    {
      "name": "lide-api",
      "path": "/home/zbynek/projects/lide-api",
      "anchor_base": "<full commit hash A>",
      "anchor_mode": "isolated",
      "rev_source": "registry"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name` — registry name = subdir name under the ticket root (unique by
  construction, spec §4). Ad-hoc paths store the basename here.
- `path` — absolute host path, stored alongside `name` so a registry rename
  only affects the *next* recreate (spec gap 7), never orphans a running
  ticket.
- `anchor_base` — resolved hash of A. The **effective** anchor is not in the
  manifest; see §3.
- `anchor_mode` — `isolated` | `shared`, per repo (`--shared-anchor <repo>`).
- `rev_source` — `arg` | `registry` | `trunk`; provenance for `status` output
  and for deciding what a repo-set-change diff shows. Informational only.
- `v` + a repos-list-of-objects shape keep the schema open for the future
  session dimension (spec gap 1): a later `sessions` key or per-repo
  `sessions` field extends without migration.

Durable identity facts only. Per-launch ephemera (workspace-file lists,
bootstrap flags, secrets paths) are **recomputed** from registry + repo config
on every `docker run` and passed as env (§4.1) — so editing a repo's
`.cld/config.toml` takes effect on the next recreate without a manifest
migration.

### 2.2 Persistence channel: labels

The manifest is persisted as container labels at `docker run`:

- `org.cld.kind=ticket`
- `org.cld.ticket=<slug>`
- `org.cld.session=cld_ticket_<slug>` (existing key, kept for broker/messenger
  readers)
- `org.cld.manifest=<the JSON above>` — authoritative, read by Python via
  `docker inspect`
- `org.cld.repo.<name>=<host path>` — one flat label per repo, for shell
  readers (the broker script greps labels today, `broker/cld-broker.sh:160-170`;
  requiring jq or a Python helper inside the SSH ForceCommand path adds a
  dependency for no gain)

**Alternative — a manifest file** (host-side `~/.cld/tickets/<slug>/manifest.json`):
rejected as the primary channel. It desynchronizes from the container (file
edited or deleted while the container runs), needs its own GC on shutdown, and
labels already survive `docker stop` — `restart` reads them from the stopped
container before `docker rm`, exactly like the task-agent record readback
pattern (`cld/task_agent.py`). Labels die with `docker rm`, but `restart` is
the only consumer that outlives a container and it reads before removing.

**Alternative — per-repo label families only** (`org.cld.repo.<name>.anchor`,
`.mode`, …): rejected as authoritative form; reassembling a typed manifest
from a flat namespace is more code and loses versioning. The dual encoding
(JSON + per-repo path labels) is written by one function in `manifest.py` so
it cannot drift. **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** — the dual encoding is deliberate
redundancy; the alternative is teaching `cld-broker.sh` to parse JSON.

Label size is not a constraint: ~200 bytes/repo, and docker labels carry
kilobytes (v1 already ships whole target lists in `org.cld.targets`,
`docker.py:699-704`).

### 2.3 How restart reads it

`cld restart <ticket>`: inspect the (running or stopped) container →
`TicketManifest.from_labels()` → stop, rm → relaunch from the manifest.
Anchors are **not** re-resolved: `anchor_base` is already a hash, and the
entrypoint's reattach branch anchors on the per-repo bookmark anyway.
`cld start <ticket> <new set>` against an existing ticket diffs the new
resolved manifest against the labeled one (keyed by `name`; a changed `path`
or `anchor_base` for a kept name counts as a change), prints the diff, asks to
confirm, tears down leaving repos (as in shutdown), recreates. The recreated
manifest keeps each kept repo's old `anchor_base`/`anchor_mode`
(`keep_attached_anchors`): the workspace reattaches at its existing bookmark,
so the old anchor is still the reality the overlap check and `cld status` must
see -- a newly requested anchor only becomes real after shutdown + start. A
kept name whose `path` changed points at a different store and does take the
new anchor at once.

## 3. The effective-anchor problem

**The problem.** In isolated mode the editable boundary is scratch commit B,
created *in-container* after `docker run`
(`entrypoint-claude-devcontainer.sh:107-121`), but labels are immutable
post-create. v1 therefore labels base A (`resolve_anchor_checked` runs before
the container exists), which makes the overlap check over-block the base
itself — the known defect behind the placeholder-commit workaround for
parallel task-agents. Spec §8 requires v2 to record the **effective** per-repo
anchor.

**Decision: derive the effective anchor at check time from the jj store; the
label keeps only base A + mode + session.** **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** — this is the
design's biggest open choice and the spec explicitly deferred it.

The derivation is the revset the entrypoint's own recovery already uses
(`_cld_recover_anchor`, `entrypoint-claude-devcontainer.sh:19-34`): given a
live container's `(anchor_base, session, mode)`,

```
effective = heads(<anchor_base>+ & description(glob:'cld anchor: <session> *'))
            if mode == isolated and the revset is non-empty
          = anchor_base   otherwise (shared mode, or B not staged yet)
```

`resolve_anchor_checked` maps each live record through this before building
reach revsets. The same derivation applies uniformly to v1 headless kinds
(they carry `org.cld.session` + `org.cld.anchor` + `org.cld.anchor-mode`
labels already, `docker.py:788-797`), which fixes the same-base sibling
over-block for task-agents too — no placeholder commits needed.

Why this beats the two channels the spec named:

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **Host-side scratch staging per repo before launch** — host creates B for each repo pre-`docker run`, labels record B | Rejected. `jj workspace add` materializes a full working copy; doing it host-side in a tmpdir per repo per launch costs seconds-to-minutes and gigabytes on large repos, adds a host-side failure/cleanup path, and duplicates the staging code (the container path must survive for restart-recovery anyway). The cheap variant — `jj new <A> --no-edit -m 'cld anchor: …'` host-side, no working copy — would make B an **empty** commit, which spec §8 explicitly rejected (alternative B: "empty commits get squashed away accidentally"); shipping the `.cld-run/` payload without a working copy has no clean jj CLI. Staging stays in-container, unchanged and proven. |
| **Post-boot manifest channel** — entrypoint writes B back to a host-readable file (mailbox mount or `~/.cld/tickets/…`) that the check consults | Rejected. Splits the source of truth in two (labels for launch facts, file for B), needs lifecycle/GC for the file, needs a mount whose only purpose is this write-back, and still has the same boot-race window (B does not exist until staging runs). The jj store **already is** the post-boot channel — B's description is commit data, put there precisely so restarts can recover it. Reading it back host-side adds a channel that already exists instead of a new one. |

**Costs of the chosen option, stated plainly:**

- The overlap check runs one extra `jj log` probe per live container per
  target repo. Bounded by live-container count; the check already shells out
  per candidate (`docker.py:975-988`).
- **Boot-race window:** between `docker run` and in-container staging, the
  derivation finds no B and falls back to A — a second launch in that window
  is checked against A's full reach, i.e. v1's over-blocking behavior,
  transiently. For tickets that is a spurious *warning*; for headless kinds a
  transient over-block. Accepted: strictly no worse than v1, self-heals in
  seconds, and the check-then-launch race is a carried gap regardless (§7).
- The check needs read access to each target repo's store. It has it: the
  check runs host-side and manifest `path` is the host path.
- Git repos have no scratch commit; effective = A there (the git backend is
  skipped by the check today anyway, and stays weaker per spec gap 8).

## 4. Boot contract

New `TICKET_MODE=1` branch in the devcontainer entrypoint. The v1
single-repo logic (`entrypoint-claude-devcontainer.sh:59-134`) is extracted
into functions in `vcs-lib.sh` parameterized by
`(origin_dir, workspace_dir, bookmark, base_rev, mode)` — the three-branch
warm-restart / reattach / first-launch logic, anchor recovery, watchman
enablement — and the ticket branch loops them over the manifest. The v1
branches call the same functions with their v1 arguments, so behavior is
shared, not forked.

### 4.1 Wire: what the launcher passes

- `-e TICKET_MODE=1`, `-e SESSION_NAME=cld_ticket_<slug>`
- `-e CLD_TICKET_MANIFEST=<same JSON as the label>` — the boot loop's input,
  parsed with jq (already a hard dependency of `build_claude_config`,
  `container-init.sh:103-149`; the image ships it)
- `-e CLD_REPO_FILES=<name>=<colon-list>;…` — per-repo `ignore_gitignore`,
  resolved **host-side** from each repo's own `.cld/config.toml` at launch.
  Alternative — entrypoint parses each repo's TOML in shell: rejected, the
  host already has a correct TOML parser and the entrypoint should stay dumb;
  cost is staleness until the next recreate, accepted.
- `-e CLD_PATH_MAP=<JSON>` — §6.4.
- One mount per repo: `-v <path>:/workspace/origin/<name>` (replaces the
  single mount + `-w` at `docker.py:543-546` for this kind). No `-w` on
  `docker run`: the daemon would pre-create the ticket root as root:root
  before the entrypoint can mkdir it as the container user; the post-boot
  `docker exec -w /workspace/<slug>` calls (§7) supply the working directory.
- **Not passed:** `AGENT_SCRATCH`, `AGENT_REVISION_HINT`, `AGENT_MODEL`,
  brief/prompt. Anchors ride in the manifest; model and prompt belong to
  `cld claude` (spec §5); the scratch payload is synthesized in-container
  (§4.2).

### 4.2 Per-repo boot loop (first launch)

For each manifest entry, in manifest order:

1. `cd /workspace/origin/<name>`; detect backend (`cld/vcs/detect.py`).
2. Three-branch workspace logic against `/workspace/<slug>/<name>` with
   bookmark `cld_ticket_<slug>`: warm restart (workspace dir exists in the
   container layer) / reattach (bookmark exists in the store) / first launch
   (`jj workspace add --name cld_ticket_<slug> -r <anchor_base> …`).
3. First launch only: stage scratch B via
   `python3 -m cld.vcs.scratch --default-payload`, a new flag that synthesizes
   `{"session": …}` locally instead of requiring `AGENT_SCRATCH`
   (`stage_from_env`, `scratch.py:103-128`, keeps its env path for v1 kinds).
   v2 tickets have no brief, so the envelope wire is dead weight for them; B's
   shape (payload file + `cld anchor: <session> mode=<mode>` description) is
   unchanged, per the §8 ruling.
4. Set the bookmark; enable watchman fsmonitor + snapshot trigger per
   workspace (v1 `:130-134`).
5. Per-repo workspace-file symlinks from `CLD_REPO_FILES` (generalizing
   `link_workspace_files`, `container-init.sh:26-39`).
6. Optional bootstrap: registry `bootstrap = true` runs `poetry install` in
   the repo's `pyproject_dir` (from the repo's `.cld/config.toml`, resolved
   host-side like `CLD_REPO_FILES`). Default off — replaces v1's unconditional
   depth-3 scan (`:162-170`), which does not scale to N repos. Alternative —
   free-form bootstrap command string: rejected for scope; a boolean covers
   the actual use-case and a command string is a later addition, not a
   redesign.

Per-repo boot failure is fatal for the whole boot (exit non-zero, no
sentinel): a ticket with a silently missing repo is worse than a failed
start, and `cld start` prints `docker logs` on readiness timeout so the
failing repo is named.

### 4.3 After the loop

1. **Ticket-root CLAUDE.md** (new; nothing writes one today) generated at
   `/workspace/<slug>/CLAUDE.md`: ticket name, one row per repo (name,
   anchor short-hash, mode, backend), the anchor contract sentence, and a note
   that each repo's own CLAUDE.md governs its subtree. Regenerated on every
   boot — it is derived state, never edited.
2. `build_claude_config` + `copy_host_configs` as today.
3. Generate the claude wrapper **without** a baked `AGENT_MODEL`
   (v1 `:172-182`); `--dangerously-skip-permissions --add-dir /opt/cld` stay
   in the wrapper (the in-container half), model comes per-invocation from
   `cld claude -- --model …`.
4. Touch `/tmp/cld-ticket-ready`; PID 1 idles (`sleep infinity` + traps).
   **Traps:** TERM → plain `exit 0`. Unlike v1 master
   (`:242-251`), the ticket entrypoint never forgets bookmarks — `docker
   stop` is the *pause* verb (spec §5), so in-container TERM must not tear
   down. All forgetting moves host-side into `cld shutdown` (per-repo
   `jj bookmark forget` + `jj workspace forget` over the manifest, the
   `_forget_session_state` pattern, `cli.py:635-672`). This also removes the
   v1 asymmetry where restart needed a special USR1 signal to *avoid*
   cleanup.

### 4.4 Readiness scaling

Host-side wait (`_wait_for_container_ready`, `cli.py:250-261`) gains a
timeout parameter: `60 + 45 × n_repos` seconds (bootstrap-enabled repos are
the slow case; a flat 60 s already cuts it close for one repo with poetry).
While waiting, `cld start` polls the sentinel and echoes new `docker logs`
lines every 10 s, so an N-repo boot is visibly progressing instead of v1's
silence (spec gap 5).

### 4.5 `cld claude` and the single-session lock

`cld claude <ticket> [-- args…]` (with
`context_settings={"allow_extra_args": True, "ignore_unknown_options": True}`,
the pattern at `cli_container.py:25,328`) execs:

```
docker exec -it -w /workspace/<slug> cld_ticket_<slug> claude <args…>
```

where `claude` is the in-container wrapper (permission-skip + `--add-dir`
baked). Single-session refusal (spec §7, POC ruling): the wrapper takes an
`flock` on `/tmp/cld-session.lock` (non-blocking; on failure prints who holds
it — the lock file carries pid + start time) for the life of the session;
`cld claude` needs no separate host-side probe because the refusal happens at
exec time with a clear message. Alternative — host-side `pgrep` before exec:
rejected, racy and claude's process name is not stable. Nothing here precludes
multi-session later: the lock is one line to lift, and cwd/transcript slugs
are per-ticket, not per-session.

Resume story is transcript-slug-driven and needs no cld state: per-ticket cwd
gives per-ticket slugs, so `-- --continue` / `-- --resume` scope to the
ticket (spec §7).

## 5. Registry

### 5.1 Reading

`Config` gains `repos: dict[str, RepoEntry]` with
`RepoEntry(path, default_rev="", bootstrap=False, mysql_config="")`.
`_load_toml` (`config.py:130-155`) currently returns known scalar/array keys
only and would warn on a `repos` table; it gains explicit handling: `repos`
is accepted as a table-of-tables, each entry validated (path exists is *not*
checked at load — only at launch, so a stale entry breaks `cld start
<ticket> that-repo`, not every cld invocation). Registry names are validated
against the task-slug regex (`_TASK_SLUG_RE`, `docker.py:725`) since they
become subdir and label-key material. `config.default.toml` gains a commented
`[repos.<name>]` template block. No under-`$HOME` constraint (spec §4 drops
it; the check at `docker.py:688-696` was a placeholder artifact and is not
carried into any v2 path).

### 5.2 Writing: tomlkit

`cld repos add <name> <path>` / `cld repos rm <name>` write
`~/.config/cld/config.toml` in place. v1 has no config writer at all (only
the template copy, `config.py:106-112`).

**Decision: use `tomlkit`** for read-modify-write of the user config.
**[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** — it is a new runtime dependency.

- The user config is a hand-edited file seeded from a heavily commented
  template. Any write path must preserve comments, ordering and unrelated
  keys, or `repos add` destroys the user's own config. tomlkit is the one
  round-trip TOML library; it is pure-Python, stable, and small.
- **Alternative — minimal writer, separate file** (`~/.config/cld/repos.toml`
  regenerated whole, trivial serializer): avoids the dependency and the
  comment problem, but contradicts the spec's ruled location (§4 shows the
  registry in `config.toml`) and splits config across two files.
- **Alternative — text surgery on config.toml** (append/delete `[repos.*]`
  blocks by regex): no dependency, but fragile against user edits inside the
  managed blocks and un-testable in the ways that matter. Rejected.

Writes are load → mutate → atomic replace (`os.replace` via a tempfile in the
same directory). `_load_toml`/tomllib remains the *read* path everywhere —
tomlkit is used only inside `registry.py` writes, so config loading gains no
dependency.

### 5.3 CRUD verbs and picker

- `cld repos` — table: name, path, default_rev, bootstrap, and a liveness
  column (which running tickets mount it — from `docker ps` label filters).
- `cld repos add <name> <path> [--default-rev R] [--bootstrap]`,
  `cld repos rm <name>`. `rm` refuses while a live or stopped ticket's
  manifest references the name+path (manifests store both, so the message can
  say which ticket).
- **Interactive picker** (TTY `cld start <ticket>` with no repos): numbered
  multi-select over the registry via `typer.prompt` ("comma-separated numbers,
  empty to abort"), then a per-selection anchor line offering
  `default_rev`/`trunk()` with an override prompt. Plain prompts, no new TUI
  dependency (nothing interactive exists in the codebase beyond typer
  prompts; a fuzzy-finder is a later nicety, not a launch requirement).
  Non-TTY with no repos: hard error naming the picker and the positional
  form (spec §5).

## 6. Repo-qualified interfaces (spec §10)

### 6.1 Broker: explicit repo target

Wire: `run-tests` and `graphql` gain a leading `--repo <name>` argument
inside the existing b64 argv (wire format `<action> <session> <b64-argv>`
unchanged, `cld/broker.py:57-85`).

Dispatcher (`broker/cld-broker.sh`): today `$REPO` comes from the caller's
single `org.cld.repo-root` label (`:749-751`). New resolution:

1. Caller has `org.cld.kind=ticket`: `--repo <name>` → `$REPO` from the
   caller's `org.cld.repo.<name>` label (grep, no JSON parsing — the reason
   for the dual encoding in §2.2). Unknown name → error listing the labeled
   names. No `--repo` and exactly one `org.cld.repo.*` label → use it
   (spec gap 6's single-repo interim, made permanent as a convenience).
   No `--repo` and several repos → error.
2. Caller is a v1 kind: `org.cld.repo-root` as today; `--repo` refused.

Validation is label-based like today's `validate_target` (`:160-170`):
labels are host-set and immutable, so a container cannot lie about its repo
set. Everything downstream of `$REPO` — `resolve_test_context`'s
`jj -R "$REPO" … -r "${session}@"` (`:102-106`), per-repo `.env` via
`resolve_secrets_env_file` (`:75-83`), `cld_conf_get` (`:57-61`) — already
keys off `$REPO` and multi-repos cleanly; the ticket owns a
`cld_ticket_<slug>` workspace in every mounted repo, so `${session}@`
resolves per repo unchanged.

Client (`cld/broker.py`) and in-container CLI: `cld broker run-tests
[--repo NAME] …`, same for the graphql MCP path (`graphql_op`,
`broker.py:175-187`). Ticket containers get the broker key mount (same trust
level as v1 master: the interactive user's own session).

### 6.2 Per-repo secrets

- `mysql_config` moves from global `Config` to `RepoEntry.mysql_config`
  (host user config — it is a host secret path, so it belongs in the
  host-owned registry, not the repo's committed-adjacent `.cld/config.toml`).
  **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** — this relocates an existing user-visible config key
  for the ticket kind (v1 kinds keep reading the global key untouched).
  Mounted per repo at `/run/secrets/mysql-<name>.cnf`. The `mysql` wrapper
  (`container-init.sh:9-14`) becomes per-repo wrappers `mysql-<name>`; plain
  `mysql` is generated only when exactly one repo has a config.
- Per-repo `.env` needs no design: broker-side resolution is already
  per-`$REPO` (§6.1), and in-workspace `.env` symlinks are the
  `ignore_gitignore` mechanism below.

### 6.3 `ignore_gitignore`

Read from each repo's own `.cld/config.toml` host-side at launch, shipped as
`CLD_REPO_FILES` (§4.1), applied to that repo's workspace only. The flattened
global `WORKSPACE_FILES` env (`docker.py:598-601`) stays v1-only.

### 6.4 Path translation: prefix map

`CLD_PATH_MAP` env: JSON object, container prefix → host prefix, longest
prefix wins:

```json
{"/workspace/origin/lide-api": "/home/zbynek/projects/lide-api",
 "/workspace/<slug>/lide-api": "/home/zbynek/projects/lide-api",
 "/home/claude": "/home/zbynek"}
```

The workspace prefixes map to the origin host path so host-facing messages
that name workspace files resolve to something the user can open (inventory
area 8). `to_host_path` (`docker.py:356-372`) consults the map first and
falls back to the scalar `CLD_HOST_PROJECT_DIR`/`CLD_HOST_HOME` pair, which
v1 kinds keep setting — the ~10 existing call sites work unmodified on both
kinds, and `agent_loop.py:137`'s display keeps working because agents are v1
kinds (spec §11 defers them). `$HOME` mapping stays in the map as one more
prefix. `Config` gains `path_map: dict[str, str]` parsed from the env.

### 6.5 Messenger and in-container target resolution

- **In-container:** already generic — `SESSION_NAME` + `MAILBOX_MOUNT`
  (`identity.py:18-19`) make `cld_ticket_<slug>` mailboxes work unchanged;
  `ensure_own_mailbox` likewise (`container-init.sh:43-56`).
- **Host-side `resolve_self`** (`identity.py:16-24`, today "the cwd repo's
  master"): new chain — `CLD_TICKET` env / `--ticket` flag → that ticket's
  container name; else if exactly one `cld_ticket_*` container is running →
  it; else fall back to the v1 master resolution (coexistence); else error
  listing running tickets. A cwd-walk mapping cwd → tickets mounting that
  repo is deliberately not attempted: several tickets can mount one repo, so
  cwd is not an identity.
- **Shortnames:** ticket slugs join repo basenames in
  `mailbox.resolve_recipient` (`mailbox.py:695+`). A slug equal to a repo
  basename is ambiguous; resolution order becomes exact container name →
  ticket slug → repo basename, with an ambiguity error naming both. The
  Mattermost bridge stays repo-keyed (deferred, spec §11).

### 6.6 In-container `cld repos` and config discovery

`cli_container.py`'s `repos` prints the manifest (name, origin path,
workspace path, anchor, mode) from `CLD_TICKET_MANIFEST`. The cwd-walk
project-config discovery (`config.py:115-127`) finds nothing from the ticket
root **by design** (spec §10): code needing a repo's `.cld/config.toml`
receives the repo name explicitly and reads
`/workspace/origin/<name>/.cld/config.toml`.

## 7. Overlap check rework

`resolve_anchor_checked` (`docker.py:926-1004`) is reworked in place:

1. **Per-repo:** called once per manifest entry at ticket launch, with that
   repo's host path and revision. Signature gains `caller_kind`.
2. **Effective anchors:** every live record — v1 headless labels *and* v2
   manifests — is mapped through the §3 derivation before reach revsets are
   built. `docker_anchor_list` (`docker.py:888-923`) grows a sibling that
   also expands ticket manifests into per-repo records
   `{name, repo_root, anchor_base, session, mode, kind}`.
3. **Warn-not-block among tickets** (spec §6b): outcome depends on
   (caller_kind, occupant_kind):
   - ticket vs ticket → **warn** and proceed (stacked tickets are
     legitimate; the warning names the occupant and the shared commit).
   - ticket vs headless (`agent`/`task-agent`/`run`) → **block**, both
     directions. Spec rules headless keep strict blocking; a ticket anchoring
     inside a live task-agent's reach is the same silent-rewrite hazard, so
     blocking is symmetric. **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** — the spec only rules the
     headless-as-caller direction explicitly.
   - anything vs master/devcontainer → ignore, as today
     (`ANCHOR_BLOCKING_KINDS`, `docker.py:885`; tickets are *not* added to
     it — they occupy trees only at warn strength against other tickets).
4. **Carried gaps fixed while touching it** (spec gap 3): **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]**
   on this scope cut —
   - *Exact-string repo-root matching* (`docker.py:966-971`): fixed —
     both sides normalized with `Path.resolve()` at record-build time, so
     symlinked paths stop bypassing the check.
   - *Fail-open on revset errors* (`_probe` returns False on failure,
     `docker.py:975-983`): fixed — a failed probe now counts as overlap:
     block for headless callers, warn ("could not verify") for ticket
     callers. A check that silently passes on error is worse than none.
   - *Running-only* (`docker_anchor_list(running_only=True)`): fixed for
     persistent kinds — stopped `ticket`/`agent`/`task-agent` containers
     still own their bookmarks and can be restarted, so they are included
     (at warn strength for stopped tickets); `run` corpses stay excluded
     (`--rm`, they cannot return).
   - *Git backends skipped* (`docker.py:962-964`): **carried.** Fixing it
     means a parallel `merge-base --is-ancestor` reach model with no scratch
     commit; git repos keep weaker guarantees everywhere (spec gap 8) and
     the user-facing docs say so.
   - *Check-then-launch race*: **carried.** A host-wide lock around
     check+launch is the fix; it is orthogonal to this rework and the §3
     boot-race fallback keeps the window's behavior no worse than v1.

## 8. Coexistence with v1

v2 lands beside `cld master` / bare devcontainer; removal is a later cleanup
(spec §14 covers migration).

- **Names:** `cld_ticket_<slug>` cannot collide with `cld_master_<repo>_<sha>`
  / `cld_agent_<repo>[_<slug>]`; slug sanitation reuses `_TASK_SLUG_RE`.
  Bookmarks/workspaces per repo likewise disjoint by prefix.
- **CLI:** root callback keeps launching the bare devcontainer; the new root
  verbs sit beside it. `cld master` keeps working unchanged. The only shared
  host code paths v2 edits under v1's feet are `to_host_path` (fallback
  preserved, §6.4), `resolve_anchor_checked` (v1 callers pass their kind and
  get strictly better behavior: effective anchors + the gap fixes) and
  `_load_toml` (additive).
- **Overlap across kinds:** one check sees all kinds (§7); a live master
  still never blocks anyone, a live ticket warns other tickets and blocks
  headless launches into its trees.
- **Broker/messenger:** dispatcher branches on caller kind (§6.1);
  `resolve_self` falls back to master resolution (§6.5). Baked skills that
  assume the master role are untouched (deferred with agents, spec §14).
- **Entrypoint:** one script, one new mode flag; v1 branches byte-identical
  except for the extraction into shared functions (covered by the existing
  e2e boot test, `tests/test_agent_e2e.py`).

## 9. Implementation-stage fixups (pre-existing defects, fix while touching)

1. **`scratch.py` docstring contradiction** (spec §8): the module header
   (`scratch.py:10-13,22-23`) claims `AGENT_ANCHOR_HASH` is A even in the
   default case; the entrypoint sets B for isolated mode
   (`entrypoint-claude-devcontainer.sh:111-121`) and the behavior is right.
   Rewrite the docstring to the spec §8 contract wording (isolated → B,
   shared → A). Same fix in `docs/design-anchor-change.md`'s 2026-08-19 note,
   which documents the wrong reading.
2. **Dead `HOST_PROJECT_DIR` branch in `container-init.sh`**
   (`:115-116`): `build_claude_config` reads `HOST_PROJECT_DIR` but the
   launcher sets `CLD_HOST_PROJECT_DIR` (`docker.py:593`), so the per-project
   MCP merge never fires. Fix to read `CLD_HOST_PROJECT_DIR` for v1 kinds;
   ticket containers merge global-scope MCP servers only (there is no single
   host project to merge from — per-repo project-scope merge is a later
   nicety, noted in the code).

## 10. Tests

- `tests/test_registry.py` (new): TOML round-trip preserves comments and
  unrelated keys; add/rm; name validation; picker parsing (prompt mocked).
- `tests/test_manifest.py` (new): schema codec, label round-trip, diff for
  repo-set change, `rev_source` provenance, forward-compat (unknown keys in a
  `v:1` manifest ignored).
- `tests/test_cli.py` / `test_cli_container.py`: new verbs dispatch; the root
  group still takes no positional (regression guard for the typer hazard);
  container stubs exit 2.
- `tests/test_docker.py`: ticket args builder (mounts, labels, env), path-map
  translation incl. longest-prefix and scalar fallback, overlap matrix
  (ticket/ticket warn, ticket/headless block both ways, effective-anchor
  derivation incl. the not-yet-staged fallback, fail-closed probe, symlinked
  path, stopped persistent container).
- `tests/test_vcs_integration.py` / a new `test_ticket_e2e.py`: two-repo
  ticket boots against real temp jj repos — per-repo bookmarks, scratch
  descriptions, warm-start vs reattach vs recreate, shutdown forgets
  everything, restart preserves anchors from labels.
- `tests/test_broker_sh.py`: `--repo` resolution against `org.cld.repo.*`
  labels, single-repo default, unknown-name error, v1 caller unchanged.
- `tests/test_mailbox.py` / `test_messenger_cli.py`: `resolve_self` chain,
  shortname ambiguity error.

Every check must be shown able to fail (mutate the guarded behavior once
during development) before it counts as coverage.

## 11. Staged implementation plan

Workstreams sized S/M/L; each lands green and independently testable.
Dependencies are hard (interface) dependencies; unmarked pairs can proceed in
parallel.

| # | Workstream | Contents | Size | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | **Registry & config** | `[repos.*]` parsing in `config.py`, `RepoEntry`, `cld/registry.py` with tomlkit writes, `cld repos` CRUD verbs, picker, `config.default.toml` template | M | — |
| W2 | **Manifest & launcher** | `cld/manifest.py` (schema, codec, resolve, diff), `docker.py`: `ticket_container_name`, `build_ticket_container_args` (per-repo mounts, labels, `CLD_TICKET_MANIFEST`/`CLD_REPO_FILES`/`CLD_PATH_MAP`), per-repo secrets mounts | L | W1 |
| W3 | **Boot loop** | entrypoint `TICKET_MODE` branch, vcs-lib extraction, scratch `--default-payload`, per-repo watchman/symlinks/bootstrap, ticket-root CLAUDE.md, readiness sentinel, §9 fixups | L | W2 (env contract) |
| W4 | **Ticket lifecycle verbs** | `cld/ticket.py` + `cli.py` verbs: start (create/warm/diff-recreate), claude (exec + session lock), shell, stop, restart-from-manifest, shutdown (host-side per-repo forget), status roster/detail, logs; scaled readiness wait | L | W2, W3 |
| W5 | **Overlap rework** | effective-anchor derivation, per-repo check, warn path, caller-kind matrix, gap fixes (paths, fail-closed, stopped containers) | M | W2 (manifest readback); independent of W3/W4 |
| W6 | **Repo-qualified seams** | broker `--repo` (script + client + MCP), `to_host_path` prefix map, messenger `resolve_self` chain + shortname rules, `cli_container.py` repos/stubs | M | W2 (labels/env); independent of W3–W5 |
| W7 | **Docs & migration** | README workspace-claims cleanup, retire `design-master-*` pointers, migration notes (§14: seed registry from `master_targets`, muscle-memory table), user-facing git-guarantees note | S | W1–W6 |

Critical path: W1 → W2 → W3 → W4. W5 and W6 fork off W2 and merge
independently. A usable single-repo ticket exists at the end of W4 even if
W5/W6 lag (single-repo broker fallback works without W6, spec gap 6).

## 12. Implementation deltas

Where the landed code (W1–W6) deviates from or extends this document. Each
verified against the working copy.

- **Repo-name regex duplicated, not imported** (§5.1 said registry names are
  validated against `docker._TASK_SLUG_RE`): `cld/registry.py` defines its own
  identical `_REPO_NAME_RE` because importing it would cycle —
  `cld.config` imports from `cld.registry`, and `cld.docker` imports
  `cld.config`.
- **`CLD_REPO_BOOTSTRAP` env added to the wire** (§4.1 listed only
  `CLD_TICKET_MANIFEST`, `CLD_REPO_FILES`, `CLD_PATH_MAP`): which repos want a
  first-boot `poetry install`, and in which `pyproject_dir`, is resolved
  host-side (`ticket_repo_bootstrap`, `cld/docker.py`) and shipped as
  `<name>=<subdir>;…`, symmetrical to `CLD_REPO_FILES`.
- **Session flock lives in the entrypoint-generated wrapper, not
  `cld/ticket.py`** (the W4 row filed "claude (exec + session lock)" under
  `cld/ticket.py`): the `TICKET_MODE` branch of the entrypoint writes
  `/tmp/bin/claude` with the flock baked in; `exec_claude` does no locking.
  Extension: host-side `cld status` probes the same lock with a non-blocking
  `flock -n` to report a live session.
- **`resolve_manifest` grew a resolver hook, and its signature carries
  `mode`** (§2 defined `resolve_manifest()` as "args + registry → manifest"
  with no resolver): anchor pinning is injected as a
  `resolver(path, revision, mode)` callable so the launch path can pass the
  overlap-checking `ticket_anchor_resolver` (which needs the per-repo anchor
  mode for the shared-anchor probe) while `cld/manifest.py` stays free of
  `cld.docker` imports.
- **`docker_anchor_list` replaced by `docker_occupant_list`** (§7 said the
  lister "grows a sibling"): the old function is gone; one lister returns the
  unified per-repo record shape `{name, repo_root, anchor_base, session,
  mode, kind}` for both v1 headless labels and expanded ticket manifests.
- **GraphQL stop teardown keys off an `org.cld.gql-repo` label** (§6.1 covered
  only start-side `--repo` resolution): `do_graphql_start` stamps the served
  repo onto the server container, and `do_graphql_stop` forgets the jj
  workspace in *that* repo — a multi-repo ticket can pass a different
  `--repo` to stop than it did to start. Server identity stays per session
  (`cld_gql_<session>`): one server per ticket container at a time.
- **`CLD_TICKET` is the `--ticket` channel** (§6.5 named the env var and the
  flag as alternatives): `cld msg`'s `--ticket` flag is exported as
  `CLD_TICKET` by `cli_msg.py` before dispatch, so `resolve_self` reads one
  channel; the messenger verb modules stay signature-unchanged.
- **Readiness sentinel cleared at boot start** (§4.3 only specified touching
  it after the loop): the container layer survives `docker stop`, so a warm
  start still sees the previous boot's `/tmp/cld-ticket-ready`; `TICKET_MODE`
  removes it before any per-repo work, or the host-side wait would return
  early.
