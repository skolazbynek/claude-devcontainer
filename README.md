# cld

Run Claude Code in Docker containers with VCS workspace isolation. Supports **jujutsu (jj)** natively and **falls back to git** when jj is not installed. Each container gets its own isolated workspace (jj workspace or git worktree) and branch, so multiple agents can work on the same repo concurrently without conflicts.

The primary interactive workflow is the **ticket container** (v2): one container per ticket, mounting one or more registered repos, driven from the host shell via `cld claude <ticket>`. See [Ticket containers](#ticket-containers-v2). The v1 interactive roles (`cld`, `cld master`) still work during the coexistence period but are superseded by tickets.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- A **jujutsu** or **git** repository (jj preferred; git used as fallback)
- Python 3.11+ with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Probably not Windows

## Setup

```bash
# Install with poetry
poetry install

# You can run from the poetry environment within CLD repo
poetry run cld --help

# To run from any directory, add `/.venv/bin/cld` to your PATH. I have `~/.local/bin/cld` symlink pointing there.

# Build images (one command builds both, devcontainer first)
cld build [--no-cache]
```

The v1 verbs (`cld`, `cld master`, `cld agent`, `cld run`, `cld chain`) must be run from within a VCS repository (jj or git) -- they operate on the cwd repo. The ticket verbs (`cld start`, `cld claude`, ...) run from anywhere: their repos come from the registry or from explicit paths.

## Usage

```bash
# Show information
cld --help

# Ticket container (v2): one container per ticket, N repos, host-driven
cld repos add lide-api ~/projects/lide-api    # register repos once
cld start LIDE-2600 lide-api                  # create the ticket sandbox
cld claude LIDE-2600                          # run Claude in it, from the host
cld claude LIDE-2600 -- --continue            # resume the ticket's last session
cld {stop | restart | shutdown | status | logs} <ticket>

# One-shot autonomous run (headless, --rm, commits to a branch)
cld run [refs...] [-n name] [-m model] [-r revision] [-p prompt]
cld run -p "Fix the auth bug in src/login.py"
cld run task.md -p "Focus on the database layer"

# Declarative multi-agent chain
cld chain run @review-implement task.md
cld chain run chains/parallel-review.yaml -p "Focus on auth code"
cld chain list
cld chain validate chains/my-chain.yaml
cld chain dry-run @review-implement

# --- v1 interactive roles (superseded by ticket containers; still work) ---

# Ephemeral interactive devcontainer (neovim, jj/git, poetry, claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions)
cld [-n name] [-m model] [-r revision] [-p prompt]   # -p only; prompt refs go to `cld run`

# Persistent per-repo interactive devcontainer (start-or-attach; idempotent per repo)
cld master                                # start or re-attach
cld master {restart | shutdown [--all] | status | logs}

# Persistent per-repo headless Claude agent (mailbox-driven)
cld agent                                 # start; never attaches
cld agent {restart | shutdown [--all] | status | logs}
```

## Ticket containers (v2)

One container per ticket. The ticket (by convention a YouTrack id) is the unit of work; the container is its sandbox. You never shell in for normal work -- the cockpit is your host terminal, and `cld claude <ticket>` execs the Claude harness inside the container. The harness sees all the ticket's repos as subdirectories of one working set:

```
/workspace/<slug>/            harness cwd -- the "ticket root" (with a generated CLAUDE.md)
  <repo-a>/                   jj workspace (or git worktree) of repo-a
  <repo-b>/
/workspace/origin/<repo-a>/   RW bind mount of the host repo
/workspace/origin/<repo-b>/
```

Full product spec: `PRODUCT_DESIGN.md`; implementation design: `docs/design-ticket-containers.md`.

### Repo registry

Repos are addressed by name from a registry in `~/.config/cld/config.toml`:

```bash
cld repos                                        # list registry + which tickets mount each repo
cld repos add lide-api ~/projects/lide-api [--default-rev R] [--bootstrap]
cld repos rm lide-api                            # refused while a ticket container mounts it
```

Each entry is a `[repos.<name>]` TOML table: `path`, optional `default_rev` (anchor offered at launch; empty means `trunk()`), and `bootstrap` (run `poetry install` in the repo's `pyproject_dir` on first boot). `cld repos add/rm` rewrites the config with tomlkit, preserving your comments and unrelated keys. Ad-hoc paths are also accepted at launch (the basename becomes the subdir name).

### Lifecycle

| Verb | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `cld start <ticket> [repo[@rev]...]` | Create-or-start. On a TTY with no repos: interactive picker over the registry. Each repo arg is a registry name or path, with an optional `@rev` anchor override. Against an existing ticket, a different repo set shows a diff, asks to confirm, and recreates the container. |
| `cld claude <ticket> [-- args...]` | The daily verb: exec the harness at the ticket root. Everything after `--` passes to claude (`--model`, `--continue`, `--resume`, `-p`). One live session per container (POC): a second `cld claude` is refused, naming the holder. |
| `cld shell <ticket>` | Escape hatch: interactive bash in the container, for debugging the sandbox itself. |
| `cld stop <ticket>` | Pause (`docker stop`). Workspaces stay in place; `cld start` on a stopped ticket is a warm start. |
| `cld restart <ticket>` | Recreate the container from its persisted launch manifest (labels, read back before removal -- no argument drop). Workspaces reattach at their bookmarks; venvs and caches in the container layer are lost. |
| `cld shutdown <ticket> [--all]` | End of ticket: teardown, forget the ticket's bookmark and workspace in every mounted repo. Commits always survive in the repo stores. |
| `cld status [<ticket>]` | Roster (repos, state, live session) or one-ticket detail (per-repo anchors, modes, bookmark tips, session, uptime). |
| `cld logs <ticket> [-n N]` | Entrypoint/boot logs. |

Resume: transcripts land on the host under the per-ticket cwd slug, so `cld claude <ticket> -- --continue` resumes the ticket's latest conversation and `-- --resume` lists only that ticket's sessions. This works even after `cld shutdown` followed by a fresh `cld start` of the same ticket -- cld itself keeps no session state.

### Anchors per repo

At first launch, each repo's anchor revision resolves as: explicit `@rev` from the launch args, else the registry `default_rev`, else `trunk()`. In isolated mode (default), a scratch commit is staged as a child of the anchor and the ticket may edit only its descendants; `--shared-anchor <repo>` (repeatable, per repo) widens the editable tree to every descendant of the anchor itself. The anchor is never written to. The contract is policy, enforced by prompt and convention, not mechanism.

When a new ticket's anchor lies inside another live ticket's editable tree in the same repo, cld **warns and proceeds** (stacked tickets are legitimate). Anchoring inside a headless container's tree (`agent`, `task-agent`, `run`) still blocks, in both directions.

**Git-backed repos get weaker guarantees:** no scratch commit (the effective anchor is the base itself), no overlap check, no watchman snapshots -- worktree semantics only.

### Persistence

Commits, the op log, and the per-repo ticket bookmark live in each host repo's store and survive everything short of `shutdown` (which forgets the bookmark; commits remain). Uncommitted edits are watchman-snapshotted into the store. Workspace dirs, venvs and caches live in the container layer: they survive `stop`, are rebuilt (workspaces) or lost (venvs) on `restart`/recreate, and are gone after `shutdown`.

### Changes from v1 behavior

Verified deliberate differences from the v1 roles:

- **Default anchor is `default_rev` -> `trunk()`, not `@`.** A v2 launch happens from anywhere, so each repo's `@` is invisible and may be unrelated WIP. Stacked work uses an explicit `repo@rev`. (v1 kinds keep defaulting to `@`.)
- **Host-side `cld msg` prefers a single running ticket.** Identity resolution is: explicit `--ticket` flag or `CLD_TICKET` env, else the one running ticket container if exactly one exists, else the v1 fallback (the cwd repo's master). cwd is deliberately not mapped to tickets -- several tickets can mount one repo.
- **Parallel same-base siblings need no placeholder commits.** The overlap check now derives each occupant's *effective* anchor (the scratch commit in isolated mode) from the jj store at check time, for v1 headless kinds too, so two isolated containers anchored on the same base no longer over-block each other.
- **A kept repo whose anchor changed on a repo-set change reattaches at its old bookmark.** `cld start <ticket> <new set>` recreates the container, but a kept repo's bookmark survives, and the boot's reattach branch wins over the new `anchor_base` -- the new anchor takes effect only after `cld shutdown` forgets the bookmark.
- **One GraphQL test server per ticket session, even multi-repo.** The broker's `graphql start` names the server container by session; a `start --repo b` while a server for repo a runs returns the running server's status rather than launching a second one. `graphql stop` tears down against the repo the server was *started* for (its own label), whatever `--repo` says.

### Migration from v1

1. **Shut down all v1 masters, devcontainers and agents first** (`cld master shutdown --all`, `cld agent shutdown --all`) -- bookmark/workspace hygiene in every repo store.
2. **Seed the registry from your `master_targets` entries:** `cld repos add <name> <path>` for each. (`master_targets` itself keeps working for the v1 master while the roles coexist.)
3. Muscle memory:

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| `cld` (bare devcontainer) | `cld start <throwaway-name> <repo>` + `cld claude <name>` |
| `cld master` | `cld start <ticket> <repo>` + `cld claude <ticket>` |
| in-container shell work | `cld claude <ticket>` (daily) / `cld shell <ticket>` (sandbox debugging) |
| `cld master shutdown` | `cld shutdown <ticket>` |
| `cld master status` / `logs` | `cld status [<ticket>]` / `cld logs <ticket>` |
| `-m model` / `-p prompt` at launch | per invocation: `cld claude <ticket> -- --model ... -p ...` |

`cld run`, `cld chain`, the broker and the messenger are unchanged; inside a ticket container the broker's `run-tests`/`graphql` take `--repo <name>` when several repos are mounted (with exactly one repo, `--repo` may be omitted).

## Agent workflow

Agent containers run detached and auto-remove on exit. Results are committed to the agent's branch as `agent-output-<session>/` containing `agent.log`, `result.json`, and `summary.json`.

## Chain workflow

`cld chain` runs a declarative sequence of named agents defined in a YAML file. Each step is an autonomous agent that receives the prior step's output as context. Steps can run in parallel (a `parallel:` group); the synthesiser step that follows sees a combined summary. Built-in chains live in `chains/` in the repo and in the installed package; reference them with `@name` shorthand.

```bash
# Run a built-in chain against a task file
cld chain run @review-implement task.md

# Run with an inline prompt instead of a task file
cld chain run @review-implement -p "Fix the N+1 query in user_repo.py"

# Run a local chain file
cld chain run chains/parallel-review.yaml task.md

# Inspect without running
cld chain list
cld chain validate @parallel-review
cld chain dry-run @review-implement
```

**Built-in chains:**

`chains/review-implement.yaml` — reviewer flags issues, implementer fixes them:

```yaml
name: review-implement
description: Reviewer flags issues, implementer fixes them.

defaults:
  model: sonnet

steps:
  - name: review
    prompts: ["@personas/reviewer"]

  - name: implement
    prompts: ["@personas/implementer"]
```

`chains/parallel-review.yaml` — two reviewers in parallel; synthesiser ranks findings:

```yaml
name: parallel-review
description: Two reviewers in parallel; synthesiser picks the most actionable.

defaults:
  model: sonnet

steps:
  - parallel:
      - name: generic
        prompts: ["@personas/reviewer"]
      - name: security
        prompts: ["@personas/security-reviewer"]

  - name: synthesise
    prompts: ["@personas/reviewer"]
    prompt: |
      Two prior reviewers produced findings. Combine them, deduplicate,
      and rank by severity. Drop anything that contradicts the user's
      original task.
```

**YAML field reference:**

| Field | Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | chain, step | Identifier; used as branch name suffix |
| `description` | chain | Human-readable summary shown by `cld chain list` |
| `defaults` | chain | Default values applied to every step (`model`, `timeout`) |
| `steps` | chain | Ordered list of step or `parallel` group items |
| `parallel` | step item | List of steps to run concurrently |
| `persona` | step | Claude persona / system-prompt name |
| `model` | step, defaults | Claude model override for this step |
| `timeout` | step, defaults | Per-agent timeout in seconds (0 = inherit `CLD_AGENT_TIMEOUT`) |
| `prompt` | step | Extra instructions appended to the step's system prompt |
| `output` | step | Explicit output file path committed by this step |
| `inputs` | step | List of prior step names whose output this step receives |

**Limitations (PoC scope):** no loops, no conditionals. For parallel groups, code changes committed by non-first siblings are not visible to the next sequential step — only text output is forwarded.

Chain env vars (see *Configuration* below): `CLD_CHAIN_MAX_PARALLEL` caps concurrent siblings; `CLD_CHAIN_DEFAULT_MODEL` overrides the model for all steps.

## VCS Backend

The tool auto-detects the VCS backend:

1. If `.jj/` exists and `jj` is installed -- **jujutsu backend** (preferred)
2. If `.git/` exists and `git` is installed -- **git backend** (fallback)

This detection runs both on the host (CLI commands) and inside containers (entrypoints). The abstraction layer lives in `cld/vcs/` (Python) and `imgs/claude-devcontainer/vcs-lib.sh` (shell).

| Concept | jujutsu | git |
|---|---|---|
| Repository marker | `.jj/` | `.git/` |
| Workspace isolation | `jj workspace add` | `git worktree add` |
| Named ref | bookmark | branch |
| Current change | `@` | `HEAD` |
| Commit | `jj commit` (auto-tracks) | `git add -A && git commit` |
| Read file from revision | `jj file show -r <rev> <path>` | `git show <rev>:<path>` |
| Common ancestor | `fork_point(A \| B)` | `git merge-base A B` |

## Messenger

Lets any cld container (ticket, master or repo agent) send a message to any other and get a reply on its next turn, backed by a shared mailbox directory on the host -- no threads, no polling required from the user. Full design and mental model: `docs/design-agent-messaging.md`.

Ticket containers get a mailbox named `cld_ticket_<slug>` and can be addressed by the ticket slug; a slug that is also some repo's basename is an ambiguity error naming both. Host-side `cld msg` acts as: the `--ticket` flag (or `CLD_TICKET` env), else the single running ticket container if exactly one exists, else the cwd repo's master.

```bash
# Register for host use (user-scoped, works from any directory)
claude mcp add -s user messenger -- /path/to/cld/scripts/mcp/run-messenger.sh

# Start a persistent, headless repo agent for the current repo
cld agent

# From any other container (master or another agent), message it by repo basename
# (inside Claude): mcp__messenger__send(to="my-repo", subject="...", body="...", expects_reply=True)
```

**Tools:** `send(to, subject, body)`, `list_inbox(unread_only)`, `read_message(id)`, `archive(id)`, `list_agents(kind)`.

**Lifecycle:**
```bash
cld agent                     # start (idempotent per repo)
cld agent restart             # rebuild + relaunch (fresh session)
cld agent shutdown [--all]    # stop + remove + cleanup
cld agent status              # supervisor phase / session / cost
cld agent logs [-n N]         # tail its log
```

The repo agent has one persistent Claude session that survives across messages -- it remembers prior conversations with a given sender, so follow-ups like "for question a, RESTRICT" resolve without re-stating context. A message sent with `expects_reply` gets exactly one reply; if the agent's turn doesn't call `send()`, the supervisor synthesizes a fallback so a question is never left hanging. Without that flag the agent stays quiet by design -- an unconditional reply makes each acknowledgment oblige another one.

```

**Image hierarchy:** `claude-base` is the parent of both `claude-devcontainer` and `claude-run` (siblings). Always build base first; `cld build` handles all three in order.

### Managing sibling agents from `cld master`

> **Superseded by ticket containers** (a multi-repo ticket mounts all its repos directly -- see [Ticket containers](#ticket-containers-v2)). Kept while the v1 master role coexists; everything below still works.

To spin up / restart / shut down persistent agents for repos other than master's own, set `master_targets` in your config (list of host paths registered as launch targets for master; each becomes an empty placeholder directory inside master's shell so `cd <path>` works, without ever bind-mounting the repo into master):

```toml
master_targets = ["~/repos/foo", "~/work/bar"]
```

Then inside master's shell:

```bash
cd /home/you/repos/repoB    # RO mount, safe to browse
cld agent                   # launches a sibling agent container for repoB
cld agent status
cld agent shutdown
```

Master itself has no filesystem view of the target repo -- only a placeholder directory so `cd` works. `cld agent` in master resolves that placeholder to the target's host path and hands it to the host broker, which runs host-side `cld agent` for RepoB (validated against master's `org.cld.targets` label). The peer container it launches gets RW at `/workspace/origin`, does its own anchor staging on boot, and forgets its bookmark on SIGTERM so master never writes to RepoB. `cld repos` inside master's shell lists what it can target.

### Workspace isolation

Containers mount the host repo RW at `/workspace/origin` (ticket containers: one mount per repo at `/workspace/origin/<name>`). The container's own entrypoint runs `jj workspace add` / `git worktree add` on boot; the workspace directory lives in the container's own filesystem layer at `/workspace/current` (tickets: `/workspace/<slug>/<name>`), never on the host. jj writes all store objects through the RW origin mount, and watchman snapshots edits into the store autonomously, so work is durable and host-visible without a host-side workspace directory. The `-r` flag pins the anchor revision for v1 kinds (default: `@` for jj, `HEAD` for git; tickets default to the registry `default_rev`, falling back to `trunk()`). On shutdown, the session's bookmark and workspace registration are forgotten from the origin store -- host-side by `cld shutdown` / `cld <role> shutdown`, plus the v1 master/bare entrypoints' own TERM/EXIT traps; committed work persists.

### Host file protection

Host `~/.claude.json` is mounted read-only. The entrypoint builds a container-local copy with MCP servers merged for the container's project path.

All RO `$HOME` mounts (claude/anthropic/jj configs, `~/.claude.json`, plus devcontainer-only `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.bashrc`, and the nvim dirs `~/.config/nvim` / `~/.local/state/nvim` / `~/.cache/nvim`) are staged read-only under `/tmp/host-config/<rel>` and copied into `$HOME` on startup by `copy_host_configs`. Changes made inside the container do not persist to the host. The agent image has no editor and skips the devcontainer-only entries.

### No docker socket in containers

No container mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` (it was equivalent to host root; see the security notes below). The two things that needed in-container docker now go through the host broker over SSH:

- **Peer enumeration** (`list_agents`, `cld agent status`): master calls the broker's `list-containers` action, which runs `docker ps` on the host and streams structured records back. Agents don't enumerate at all -- message replies address the sender by the full name carried in the message, delivered by filesystem, so agents need no host channel.
- **Launching a sibling `cld agent` from inside master**: `cld agent` in master resolves the cwd's target repo and calls the broker's `agent` action, which runs host-side `cld agent` for that repo (validated against the master's host-set `org.cld.targets` label). Arg-building, anchor staging, and image builds all happen natively on the host.

See `cld/broker.py` (the host-vs-broker seam) and `broker/cld-broker.sh` (the actions). Path translation (`CLD_HOST_PROJECT_DIR`/`CLD_HOST_HOME`) still converts container paths to host paths for target resolution; it is now set unconditionally rather than riding along with the socket mount.

### Security model and known gaps

Containers run as host UID/GID with `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, and resource limits (2 CPU, 4GB RAM).

**Known gaps -- read carefully before shipping anything sensitive into a container:**

- **No outbound network firewall.** Once an agent is running, it can reach any host on the public internet and exfiltrate anything mounted in (`~/.claude` tokens, `~/.claude.json` MCP creds, `~/.config/*` creds). Anthropic's reference devcontainer ships an `init-firewall.sh` with default-deny outbound and a small allowlist; cld does not (yet) ship an equivalent.
- **No docker socket is mounted (was: host root).** Earlier versions mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` for peer enumeration, which let an agent run `docker run -v /:/host --privileged ...` and read or modify anything on the host -- bypassing every other control. The socket is gone; master's only host channel is now the broker key (a fixed, non-eval action allowlist with label-validated targets -- see the host broker section), and agents have no host channel at all. A leaked broker key grants that action set (run-tests + sibling `cld agent` lifecycle for allowlisted repos), which is strictly narrower than arbitrary host root but still privileged -- protect the key accordingly.
- **`~/.claude` is mounted rw.** A malicious agent can both read your OAuth tokens and overwrite session state.

## Configuration

Any command checks for `~/.config/cld/config.toml` and creates a default file if it doesn't exist. Adjust it as you need - especially what paths are mounted into the devcontainer. You can create a per-project overrides with `<repo_root>/.cld/config.toml`.

### Resolution order

Lowest → highest priority:

1. Dataclass defaults
2. User TOML — `~/.config/cld/config.toml`
3. Project TOML — `<repo_root>/.cld/config.toml` (walked up from cwd)
4. `.env` in cwd
5. `CLD_*` env vars

### TOML schema

Flat snake_case keys mirroring `Config` field names, valid in both `~/.config/cld/config.toml` (user-wide) and `<repo_root>/.cld/config.toml` (per-repo). Unknown keys are warned about on stderr and ignored. Array-typed keys take a TOML array of strings. `host_project_dir` / `host_home` are container-internal and not exposed via TOML. The one table-typed key is the ticket repo registry, `[repos.<name>]` in the *user* config (see [Repo registry](#repo-registry)): per entry `path`, `default_rev`, `bootstrap`.

```toml
base_image = "claude-base:latest"
devcontainer_image = "claude-devcontainer:latest"
run_image = "claude-run:latest"
agent_timeout = 1800
poll_interval = 30
debug = false
```

Full set of keys:

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `base_image` | string | `"claude-base:latest"` | Common base Docker image |
| `devcontainer_image` | string | `"claude-devcontainer:latest"` | Devcontainer image (`cld`, `cld master`) |
| `run_image` | string | `"claude-run:latest"` | One-shot run image (`cld run`) |
| `pyproject_dir` | string | `"."` | Directory (relative to repo root) holding `pyproject.toml` and `.env`. Not a `Config` field -- read directly out of `.cld/config.toml` by `cld-broker.sh` on the host, for the broker's `PROJECT_SUBDIR` and secrets path (see "Host-side test running" in `CLAUDE.md`) |
| `ssl_certs_path` | string | `""` | Opt-in override: host path (dir or PEM file) that **replaces** the baked CA bundle. Empty = use the baked bundle |
| `home_mounts_always` | array of strings | `[".claude.json", ".config/anthropic", ".config/claude", ".config/jj"]` | RO `$HOME` paths staged into every container |
| `home_mounts_devcontainer` | array of strings | `[".gitconfig", ".bashrc", ".config/nvim", ".local/state/nvim", ".cache/nvim"]` | Additional RO `$HOME` paths staged only for interactive devcontainer sessions |
| `master_targets` | array of strings | `[]` | Host repo paths registered as launchable sibling targets from inside `cld master` (v1; tickets use the registry below) |
| `repos.<name>` | TOML table | none | Ticket repo registry entry (`path`, `default_rev`, `bootstrap`); user config only, managed by `cld repos add/rm` |
| `ignore_gitignore` | array of strings | `[]` | Gitignored files (e.g. `.env`) to symlink from `/workspace/origin` into the isolated workspace |
| `agent_timeout` | int (seconds) | `1800` | Chain orchestrator's per-agent wait timeout |
| `poll_interval` | int (seconds) | `30` | Chain orchestrator's docker-ps poll interval |
| `chain_max_parallel` | int | `4` | Max agents launched concurrently in a chain's parallel group |
| `chain_default_model` | string | `""` | Model override for chain agents; empty = each step's own default |
| `ssh_auth_sock` | string | unset (auto-detect) | SSH agent forwarding into every devcontainer-image launch (`cld`, `master`, `agent`, `task-agent`). Unset = auto-detect host `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`; `""` = explicitly disable; a path = use that socket. Launches the broker makes on a master's behalf need `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` in `broker.conf` -- see `broker/README.md` |
| `mailbox_root` | string | `"~/.cld/mailboxes"` | Host root of the inter-container mailbox tree (bind-mounted RW into every master/agent) |
| `agent_max_turns` | int | `120` | Per-message turn cap passed to the repo agent's `claude -p --max-turns` |
| `agent_kickoff_persona` | string | `"agent"` | Persona used to kick off a new `cld agent` Claude session |
| `broker_key` | string | `""` | Host path to the restricted broker **private** key. Setting this enables `cld broker <action>` inside `cld master`. Master-only |
| `broker_endpoint` | string | `"host.docker.internal:2222"` | Broker SSH endpoint, `[user@]host:port` (default login user `zet`) |
| `broker_known_hosts` | string | `""` | Host path to the pinned `known_hosts` for the broker; required for the client's strict host-key check |
| `log_level` | string | `"INFO"` | Root level for the `cld` logger hierarchy: `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR` |
| `log_color` | string | `"auto"` | ANSI color in log output: `auto` (TTY-detect) / `always` / `never` |
| `debug` | bool | `false` | Diagnostics flag; back-compat alias for `log_level = "DEBUG"` when `log_level` is otherwise unset |

Every key above also has a `CLD_*` env var equivalent that overrides it (see below) except the array-typed ones (`home_mounts_always`, `home_mounts_devcontainer`, `master_targets`, `ignore_gitignore`), the `repos` registry table, and `pyproject_dir` (not a `Config` field), which are TOML-only.

### `CLD_*` env vars (defaults shown)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLD_BASE_IMAGE` | `claude-base:latest` | Common base Docker image |
| `CLD_DEVCONTAINER_IMAGE` | `claude-devcontainer:latest` | Devcontainer image |
| `CLD_RUN_IMAGE` | `claude-run:latest` | One-shot run image |
| `CLD_HOST_PROJECT_DIR` | `""` | Host repo root path; set by host launcher into containers for nested docker path translation |
| `CLD_HOST_HOME` | `""` | Host home directory (for path translation) |
| `CLD_AGENT_TIMEOUT` | `1800` | Chain's per-agent wait timeout (seconds) |
| `CLD_POLL_INTERVAL` | `30` | Chain's docker-ps poll interval (seconds) |
| `CLD_CHAIN_MAX_PARALLEL` | `4` | Max agents running concurrently in a parallel chain group |
| `CLD_CHAIN_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `""` | Model override for all chain steps; empty = use chain YAML default |
| `CLD_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Root level for the `cld` logger hierarchy (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR) |
| `CLD_LOG_COLOR` | `auto` | ANSI color in log output: `auto` / `always` / `never` |
| `CLD_DEBUG` | `false` | Diagnostics flag. Back-compat alias: truthy ⇒ `CLD_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` |

### Logging

`cld` writes diagnostic output via the stdlib `logging` module. All log records go to **stderr**; stdout is reserved for user-facing deliverable output (final reports, list rows, prompts).

| Env var | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `CLD_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | DEBUG / INFO / WARNING / ERROR |
| `CLD_LOG_COLOR` | `auto` | auto / always / never |
| `CLD_DEBUG` | `false` | Back-compat alias: truthy ⇒ `CLD_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` |

The same keys can be set in TOML: `log_level`, `log_color`.

At DEBUG, every subprocess invocation (Docker, jj, git) and every VCS operation is logged with full command and exit code. At INFO (default), only major lifecycle events appear (agent starts/stops, image builds, chain steps).

## Development

```bash
poetry install

# Unit tests (no docker, no network)
poetry run pytest -m "not integration and not docker and not e2e"

# Integration tests
poetry run pytest -m integration

# Tests that need Docker
poetry run pytest -m docker

# End-to-end tests (slow, real containers)
poetry run pytest -m e2e
```

Test markers are declared in `pyproject.toml`. The `tests/conftest.py` detects when running inside the devcontainer via `CLD_HOST_PROJECT_DIR` to translate paths.
