"""Launch manifest for ticket containers (docs/design-ticket-containers.md section 2).

The manifest is the resolved repo set stamped into container labels at
``docker run``: the single source of truth for restart, status and broker
target validation. It carries durable identity facts only -- per-launch
ephemera (workspace-file lists, secrets paths) are recomputed from registry
and repo config on every recreate. Labels record the base anchor A plus mode
and session; the effective anchor B is derived from the jj store at check
time, never labeled.

This module must not import cld.config or cld.docker at runtime: cld.docker
imports from here.
