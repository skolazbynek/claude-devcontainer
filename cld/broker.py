"""The cld broker seam: local docker on the host, SSH to the host broker in a container.

On the host, cld talks to the Docker daemon directly. Inside a container there is no
docker socket (removed by design -- see docs/design-cld-broker.md); the only host
channel is the broker: an sshd whose ForceCommand is `broker/cld-broker.py`, reached
here by building the ssh argv ourselves. This module centralizes that host-vs-broker
decision so call sites stay backend-agnostic.

The set of functions here is deliberately the entire surface reachable from inside a
container -- each maps 1:1 to an `action_<name>` in the broker script. Anything not
exposed here simply cannot be done from a container, by construction.
