"""Filesystem mailbox transport shared by the messenger MCP server and the agent supervisor.

Layout under a mailbox root (``~/.cld/mailboxes`` by default, see ``cld.config``):

    <root>/<container_name>/tmp/       -- write-here-first staging
    <root>/<container_name>/inbox/     -- unread messages, one <id>.json per message
    <root>/<container_name>/archive/   -- dealt-with messages
    <root>/<container_name>/outbox.log -- append-only trail of sent messages (full bodies)
    <root>/<container_name>/meta.json  -- task-agent spawn facts, written once at boot
    <root>/<container_name>/state.json -- supervisor liveness (written by agent_loop)
    <root>/_archive/<container_name>/  -- whole mailbox, moved here on teardown
    <root>/_edges/<a>--<b>.json        -- per-edge hop counter (peer-loop control)

Entries under the root whose name starts with ``_`` are reserved and are not
mailboxes. ``meta.json`` and ``state.json`` are split by lifetime: what an agent
*is* versus what it is *doing*, so a stale copy of one can't shadow the other.

All mutations are same-filesystem ``rename()`` calls, so no reader ever observes
a partial write. Pure filesystem code -- no MCP/FastMCP imports here so it stays
unit-testable with ``tmp_path``. Container enumeration (the one non-filesystem
bit) is delegated to ``cld.host_docker`` and imported lazily inside
``list_containers``.

    **A spent edge is silent** (docs/design-task-agents.md D29). On an agent<->agent
    edge that has already delivered its whole hop budget, nothing more goes over it --
    not a retry, not a supervisor-authored reply, not a notice about the budget itself.
    Every sender in the codebase passes through here, which is what makes that rule
    hold for all of them and bounds an edge at ``limit`` messages for its whole life.

    message still obliges a reply, and the reply is refused, which produces another
    message...

    A **reaped** recipient is refused for the same reason: this function creates a
    missing mailbox (that is how a first message reaches a fresh container), so
    delivering to a torn-down agent would resurrect its directory, shadow the archived
    ``meta.json`` behind an empty live one, and quietly un-budget the edge. §10 already
    says messages to a reaped peer "go nowhere" -- this makes that a refusal instead of
    a silent write into a void.
