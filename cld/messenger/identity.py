"""Resolve ``(own_container_name, mailbox_root)`` for a messenger CLI verb.

In a cld container the identity is trivial: ``SESSION_NAME`` and the fixed
``MAILBOX_MOUNT``. On the host we act *as* a container -- reads and writes
target that mailbox, and outgoing messages list it as the sender. Which one
(design-ticket-containers.md section 6.5): an explicit ticket (``CLD_TICKET``
env or the *ticket* argument) wins, but only if its container actually exists
(running or stopped) -- otherwise sends would be attributed to a mailbox
nothing ever reads; else the single running ticket container, if there is
exactly one; else the cwd repo's host identity (``host_identity_name``, the
mailbox the v1 master used to own). A cwd-walk mapping cwd to tickets is
deliberately not attempted -- several tickets can mount one repo, so cwd is
not an identity.
