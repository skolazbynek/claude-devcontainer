# Messenger: send message

Compose a message from the user's intent and deliver it.

## Step 1: Resolve the recipient

If the user did not name a recipient, list available targets:

```bash
cld msg agents
```

The recipient is the container `name` (or its repo basename as a shortname).
An agent is preferred over a master when both exist for the same shortname.

**Task-agents and peers must be addressed by full container name** -- several
task-agents can share one repo, so a basename identifies nothing and the send is
refused as ambiguous.

## Step 2: Draft subject and body

From the user's intent, draft:

- **Subject** — one line, imperative, specific. No trailing period.
- **Body** — markdown. State the ask (or the update) and give the minimum context
  the recipient needs to act. Skip preamble and sign-offs; the transport already
  records who sent it.

Then decide whether this message obliges an answer, because the transport carries
that as a flag rather than inferring it from the body:

- `--expects-reply` — only for a question the sender cannot proceed without. It is
  what obliges the recipient to reply; without it the recipient is told to send
  nothing back, which is the intended behavior for updates and hand-offs.
- `--answers <id>` — set whenever this message answers one that came in, even if it
  also asks something new.

Confirm the draft with the user before sending unless they asked to send
immediately.

## Step 3: Deliver

Write the body to a tmp file (multi-line safe) and invoke the sender:

```bash
BODY_FILE="$(mktemp -t messenger-send-body.XXXXXX.md)"
cat > "$BODY_FILE" <<'EOF'
<the drafted body verbatim>
EOF
cld msg send --to <recipient> --subject "<subject>" --body-file "$BODY_FILE" \
    [--expects-reply] [--answers <id>]
rm -f "$BODY_FILE"
```

Report the returned id to the user.

## Hop budget (agent-to-agent only)

A message between two task-agents counts against that edge's absolute hop budget, and
the output reports your position: `sent: <id>  a -> b  (hop 3/10)`. Converge as it
nears the limit -- land the exchange rather than letting it drift.

Once the budget is spent the send is **refused** (exit 1) and nothing is delivered, in
either direction, ever again on that edge. Do not retry it and do not work around it:
tell your master, whose channel is never budgeted, and let it decide what happens next.
Messages to a master are never counted.

## Ask budget (agent-to-agent only)

A peer edge also bounds how many questions may be open on it at once, reported as
`(open asks 2/3)`. Only `--expects-reply` sends count, and the counter clears when the
question the exchange started from is answered.

Past the limit, **the ask is refused but the edge stays open** -- an answer or a plain
update still delivers. So the two ways out are to answer the open question with a
stated assumption, or to ask the master to rule. Never re-send the same question.
